Statistics is based on probability. Probability is a purely epistemological measure. Meaning that probability is not connected to the object, but it's just a measure of how strong is the evidence for some belief related to the analysed object. 

Take an example: what's the probability of you dying in a car crash? Noow what;s the probability of you dying in a car crash given that you have broken breaks and you are going down a hill?
