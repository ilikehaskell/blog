Don't give users the responsibility of finding the optimal way to solve their problem under the pretext of flexibility (users literally told me this). Put it another way, be opinionated.
Don’t try to solve more than one problem. Put it another way, be opinionated.
Get fast feedback on your opinionated design and iterate. Best way is to find a possible user, give them the app link and observe what they do.
Try to record or take notes on the user interview
When iterating, you’ll see that you’ll probably delete code and become even more opinionated
reuse code and you’ll see that an even simpler solution would have done a better job (even for the problem the reused code comes from)

For analytics tools:
be sure that it’s clear what controls are associated with what view
